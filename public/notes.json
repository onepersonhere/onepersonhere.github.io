On top of that you still are required to do coding tasks, which could take up literally 1 whole day.</p><p>You would start off with the theory of recursion, and some basic programs that limit your answer to using solely recursion. This encourages you to think in a different way - a way where a programmer should think. This way of thinking would help you in your future career as a programmer/computer scientist.</p><p>All in all, CS1101S is definitely memorable for me, and itâ€™s definitely much better than other CS1010 modules in terms of the concepts we learnt.</p>",

If you do not have such knowledge, then it will be very hard to chase for top grades. Furthermore, the <code>S</code> version meant that all students taking the mod is from CS, and the bell curve would be disadvantages to those who do not have strong fundamentals in mathematical logic.</p><p>The topics covered are the following:</p><ul><li>Logic and proof techniques propositions, conditionals, quantifications.</li><li>Relations and Functions Equivalence relations and partitions. Partially ordered sets. Well-Ordering Principle.</li><li>Function equality. Boolean/identity/inverse functions. Bijection.</li><li>Mathematical formulation of data models (linear model, trees, graphs).</li><li>Counting and Combinatoric Pigeonhole Principle. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.</li><li>Number of relations on a set, number of injections from one finite set to another, Diagonalization proof An infinite countable set has an uncountable power set.</li><li>Algorithmic proof An infinite set has a countably infinite subset.
